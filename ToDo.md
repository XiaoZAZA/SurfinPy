### To Do List

- Documentation of functions. Documentation does not exist for the new features. The bones have been added and type/description needed have been written where information is needed. If you come across either of these it is because that info is missing. e.g. type means, what is the type?
- Tests for bulk_mu_vs_my, bulk_mu_vs_t, data, vibrational_data
- Full tutorials for the bulk sections. I have got the code to work for 5 bulk tutorials. However full markdown walkthroughs are needed
- Website docuemntation - Theory will need to be rewritten to account for the update. If the 5 bulk tutorials are written I will be able to do the website. 
- Website gallery - cool figures are needed for the gallery
- Second paper - Josh you will need to write the new paper asap. Title needed.
- Write a changelog outlining the massive changes
