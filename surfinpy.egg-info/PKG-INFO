        SurfinPy is a python toolkit for plotting and analysis of ab initio solid state surface calculation data, built on existing python pakcages. It is hoped that these tools will provide publication ready plots (powered by Matplotlib)
        
        ### Installation
        
        To build from source:
        
        ```python
        
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        python setup.py build
        
        python setup.py install
        
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        Check out the tutorials included in the examples folder. There are standard .py input files to give examples of what inputs and outputs should look like. To gain greater insight view the .ipynb tutorials using a jupyter notebook, these are a blend of python inputs and markdown explanations.
